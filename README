INSTRUCTIONS

All you have to do is compile the cpp files using g++ or any ansi standard compiler.

example: 

g++ -o fastMatrix *.cpp *.h

Type ./fastMatrix to run it. You may wish to modify main.cpp to experiment with the various features of the fastMatrix class. The interface is documented in fastMatrix.h and within the manual.pdf.
